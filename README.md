## ⛰️ Beyond the Code

When I'm not focused on system architecture, you might find me pursuing physical challenges.

> **Fun Fact:** I love the challenge of combining the digital and the physical world: I can climb a mountain and be attending a meeting at the summit! It's all about reliable connections, in life and in software.
